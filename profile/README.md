# 🪰 Rose Mueller Lab 🪰

Welcome to the GitHub organization of the **Rose Mueller Lab** at the **Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine**.

We are pioneering a new kind of biology—one built not on the reductionist frameworks of the past century, but on the power of **genomics**, **experimental evolution**, and **bioinformatics**. Our mission is to develop a data-driven, systems-level understanding of biological function and evolution using experimental methods and large-scale genetic analysis.

## Lab Philosophy

**Building the New Biology through Experimental Evolutionary Genomics**

The dominant reductionist biology of the 20th century—focused on simple pathways and large-effect substitutions—has reached its limits. Genomic research has shown us that sexual populations carry vast, functional, genome-wide variation that defies oversimplification. To address this complexity, biology must evolve.

## What We Study

Our foundational work is focused on **aging**. Moreover, our work is rooted in **experimental evolution**, empowered by an extensive archive of evolving populations, many of which already have full-genome sequencing data. Collaborations—especially with **Dr. Joseph L. Graves, Jr.**—have deepened and extended this work, with more sequencing and analysis ongoing.

We maintain one of the **largest and most diverse phylogenies of outbred, experimentally evolved sexual populations** known in the field.
