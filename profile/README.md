# 🌱 Rose-Mueller Experimental Evolution Lab

Welcome to the GitHub organization of the **Rose and Mueller Laboratories** at the **Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine**.

We are pioneering a new kind of biology—one built not on the reductionist frameworks of the past century, but on the power of **genomics**, **experimental evolution**, and **bioinformatics**. Our mission is to develop a data-driven, systems-level understanding of biological function and evolution using experimental methods and large-scale genetic analysis.

## 🔬 Lab Philosophy

**Building the New Biology through Experimental Evolutionary Genomics**

The dominant reductionist biology of the 20th century—focused on simple pathways and large-effect substitutions—has reached its limits. Genomic research has shown us that sexual populations carry vast, functional, genome-wide variation that defies oversimplification. To address this complexity, biology must evolve.

In our labs, we are working to create this **new biology**. Our approach integrates:

* **Experimental Evolution**
* **Genome-Wide Sequencing and Analysis**
* **Large-Scale Bioinformatics**
* **New Theoretical Frameworks in Evolutionary Genetics**

We don’t claim to have all the answers—but we are building the tools to start asking the right questions.

## 🧪 What We Study

While our foundational work focused on **aging**, our research has expanded to include:

* **Speciation**
* **Developmental Biology**
* **Convergent Evolution**
* **Social Behavior**
* **Cardiovascular and Vision Biology**
* **Effective Population Size and Genetic Drift**

Our work is rooted in **experimental evolution**, empowered by an extensive archive of evolving populations, many of which already have full-genome sequencing data. Collaborations—especially with **Dr. Joseph L. Graves, Jr.**—have deepened and extended this work, with more sequencing and analysis ongoing.

## ⚙️ How We Work

We maintain one of the **largest and most diverse phylogenies of outbred, experimentally evolved sexual populations** known in the field. Our lab combines:

* High replication
* Deep time-series datasets
* Hypothesis-driven design
* Robust statistical power despite high genomic complexity

Our experimental scale allows us to challenge—and often dismantle—entrenched assumptions in evolutionary biology.
